# Readmission-Analysis-of-Diabetes-patients

### Objective
Diabetes, a chronic and prevalent health issue, poses significant challenges in healthcare, leading
to higher rates of hospital readmissions. Hospital readmission, the return of a patient within a
specific timeframe after discharge, is particularly common among those with diabetes. The
frequency of readmissions serves as a critical metric for evaluating hospital quality and the
effectiveness of diabetes management.

### Problem Definition:
The project aims to leverage data mining techniques to analyze diverse medical data related to
diabetic patients. Specifically, the goal is to predict whether a diabetic patient will be readmitted
to the hospital based on various factors, including age, gender, admission type, medications
administered, duration of hospitalization, laboratory test results.

### Data Sources:
The primary data source for this project is UCI Machine Learning Repository, from which this
dataset is obtained https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008

### Data Description:
The dataset spans a significant temporal window from 1999 to 2008, originating from a
comprehensive network of 130 US hospitals. Comprising over 100,000 patient records, this dataset
encompasses a variety of information, featuring a total of 50 attributes. Within this dataset, 13 are
numerical, and 47 are categorical, offering a multi-dimensional perspective on clinical care.
Noteworthy among the features are 23 indicators detailing various medications shedding light on
prescription specifics and dosage changes. The dataset is comprehensive, covering a spectrum of
attributes like patient identification numbers, race, gender, age, admission types, physician
specialties, lab test metrics, HbA1c test results, diagnoses, medication counts, diabetic
prescriptions, and counts of outpatient, inpatient, and emergency visits in the year preceding
hospitalization. The target column to the analysis is the 'readmitted' column, offering insights into
patient readmission patterns. With values denoting readmission within "<30" days, ">30" days, or
"NO" record, this dataset provides a robust foundation for exploring and understanding the
dynamics of diabetic patient readmissions over the specified period.
